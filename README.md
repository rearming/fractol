# fract'ol
Fractal rendering project (42-fract'ol), accelerated via OpenCL.

### Build:
```
./compile.sh
```
**WARNING! OpenCL library and headers are requiered to build and run this project!**
### Run:
```
./fractol [name]
```
Possible variants: mandelbrot, julia, burningship, triangle.

### Usage:
You can move fractal on arrows, zoom into with mouse wheel and use self-written terminal

**(Terminal commands are shown on screenshots, but you also can run "help" command in it to see help message)**

### Mandelbrot:

### Julia:

### Some interesting places in mandelbrot:
**Somewhere deep inside self-replicated mandelbrot**

### Sierpinski Triangle:
**You can run "set iter 1" in terminal and then press Space to increase number of recursive calls (basically, make more triangles!)**
